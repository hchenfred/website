# Biography

My name is Huan. I am a full stack engineer living in San Francisco Bay Area. I am proficient with web technologies including Javascript (React, ES6), HTML, CSS, and Node.js.

To me, programing is like solving a puzzle. There are moments when you feel frustrated. However, no jobs in the world will give you the same sense of achievement that you get from solving the puzzle by coding. I quitted my well-paid job in pursuit of my dream of being a web developer. I got my front-end nanodegree from Udacity. I got accepted by Georgia Tech part-time Computer Science Master degree program and completed two courses with GPA of 4.0. I spent over 900 hours building web applications at Hack Reactor.
